== Description ==

A plugin to show UserAgent information in comments list.
Base on the WordPress plugin [Comment Info Detector](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comment-info-detector/ "Comment Info Detector") developed by [HieuDT](http://hieudt.info/) and "IP2C" as IP database.

The original author has not updated that plugin any more. But still so many wp users hope to use the new IP database and new browser icos, so i make it a new branches named "Show Useragent" to keep update.

  More details:
In this plugin, more browser and OS will be distinguished like IE9+/Chrome8+/FireFox 4+/Android/iPad/iPhone 4S ect.
And also IP database will always be the newest one.
